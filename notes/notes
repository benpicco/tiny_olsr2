IPv6 or node ids?
	-> not unique enough
UDP packages or raw frames?
	-> we need from, length (and to if we handle routing)

currently we assume assume flooding MPR == routoing MPR
	-> How do we gather metrics?

Why are nodes in the topology set not unique? Is it sufficient to just store the shortest route?

Why is seq_no associated with last_addr?
