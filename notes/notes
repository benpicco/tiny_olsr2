ITIME is the same for all nodes, don't send or store it seperately

IPv6 or node ids?
	-> not unique enough
UDP packages or raw frames?
	-> we need from, length (and to if we handle routing)

currently we assume assume flooding MPR == routoing MPR
	-> How do we gather metrics?

Why are nodes in the topology set not unique? Is it sufficient to just store the shortest route?
	-> store alt routes in a seperate list

add sender_addr parameter to is_known_msg() so we can actually route the TC originator?
	last_addr = null -> problem?

Why does metric_encode use 32bit for link metrics?
	8 bit for link metric
	16 bit for route metric (max is 256 hops)
	are enough
