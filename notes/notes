ITIME is the same for all nodes, don't send or store it seperately

IPv6 or node ids?
	-> not unique enough
UDP packages or raw frames?
	-> we need from, length (and to if we handle routing)

currently we assume assume flooding MPR == routoing MPR
	-> How do we gather metrics?
	-> skip the metrics problem, we don't have ways to measure link quality
